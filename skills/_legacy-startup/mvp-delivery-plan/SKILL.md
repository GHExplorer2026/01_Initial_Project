# Mvp Delivery Plan

## Overview

Turn planning artifacts into a realistic MVP execution plan that teams can immediately run. Use `references/mvp-plan-template.md` as the default structure.

## Workflow

1. Confirm delivery inputs
- Validate PRD scope, architecture constraints, and team capacity.
- Freeze MVP scope before estimation.

2. Slice backlog vertically
- Create user-visible slices that deliver end-to-end value.
- Keep each slice small enough for one sprint or less.

3. Sequence milestones
- Define 3-5 milestones with measurable completion criteria.
- Map dependencies and highlight critical path work.

4. Estimate and staff
- Estimate each slice with a consistent method (story points or t-shirt sizing).
- Assign owners and required skills per milestone.

5. Add risk and contingency
- Record schedule, technical, and operational risks.
- Define mitigation and contingency triggers.

6. Set execution rules
- Define Definition of Ready and Definition of Done.
- Define demo cadence, release cadence, and rollback expectations.

## Output Rules

- Avoid date precision when uncertainty is high; use ranges.
- Keep one source of truth for milestone status.
- Keep scope changes explicit with impact notes.
- Reject plans without risk mitigation and ownership.

## Deliverables

- `MVP Delivery Plan` from `references/mvp-plan-template.md`
- Prioritized milestone backlog
- Dependency and risk map
